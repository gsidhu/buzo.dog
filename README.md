# buzo.dog
A no nonsense internet explorer.

## What is this site?
Buzo.dog is a no nonsense internet explorer. The internet has all sorts of beautiful weirdness to it. Buzo helps you explore it.

## What can I do here?
A couple of things. You can 'Fetch' a cool link, or you can go for a 'Walk' and decide which link to follow. Buzo will be with you through it all, in spirit.

## This is a cool site. Can I help?
Sure! You can help me cover the cost of keeping this site up and for buying Buzo treats. (belly rubs cost extra) Head over to the Sponsor links in this repository to donate.

## What features are in the pipeline?
A bunch -
1. Publication Reader: Kind of like an RSS reader but for reading best-of archives instead of the latest
2. Categorised Viewing: Looking for comics, articles, news, cool sites? We got them
3. User Profiles: Upload your bookmarks, share them across devices, maintain your personal reading lists (read, to-read) - all in a secure and private environment; no login, no data shared with anyone
